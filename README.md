## Description
GreenMile project at PennApps
## Inspiration
In freshman year, it was difficult for me to get a second-hand bike in Philly when I needed one. As a huge fan for second-hand goods, I desperately hope there was a second-hand trading platform where both the buyers and the sellers can think more in terms of sustainability. As it turns out, second-hand goods not only save money, but they also mean a great deal to having a sustainable environment. Buying second-hand goods reduces consumption and hence production and the carbon footprint that comes with it, with research showing that encouraging second-hand goods trading saves significant energy and transportation costs. Hence, I decided to build a trading platform with features to encourage second hand trading for sustainability. 

## What it does
The platform is called GreenMile. It has a central marketplace where people can trade any second-hand goods. Buyers can give price offers and the owner can reach out to the person they want to sell the goods. When a person buys something or when they sell something, they will get greenmile points(gms) , with which they can use to trade in goods. I hope this 

## How I built it
Built frontend using React and Bootstrap; Backend using Node.js and mongoDB

## Challenges we ran into
It was difficult to figure out and design the state control.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
In 36 hours built something that's a working product

## What we learned
I may have all kinds of ideas and ambitions about the project, but should start with one idea first rather than spending time hesitating.

## What's next for GreenMile
Include picture upload so users are able to see the goods. 

Set milestones and badges to give more tangible measurement of success.

Next, to give the platform a social media aspect, implement the friends features where friends can see each other's gms or even have a gms ranking for groups of friends to give more motivations. 

Look for potential APIs for a carbon footprint calculator. It would be great if users can calculate the carbon footprint for the goods, which would enable more accurate gms point value calculation and also raise awareness among the users about carbon footprint of daily products.
